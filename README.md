This project allows you to use various hardware security devices to operate GPG and SSH.  Instead of keeping your key on your computer and decrypting it with a passphrase when you want to use it, the key is generated and stored on the device and never reaches your computer.  Read more about the design [here](doc/DESIGN.md).

You can do things like sign your emails, git commits, and software packages, manage your passwords (with [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and [gopass](https://www.justwatch.com/gopass/), among others), authenticate web tunnels and file transfers, and more.
