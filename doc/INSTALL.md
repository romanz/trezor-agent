# Installation

## 1. Prerequisites

Install the following packages (depending on your distribution):

### OS dependencies

This software needs Python, libusb, and libudev along with development files.

You can install them on these distributions as follows:

##### Debian

    $ apt install python-pip python-dev python-tk libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev

##### Fedora/RedHat

    $ yum install python-pip python-devel python-tk libusb-devel libudev-devel \
                  gcc redhat-rpm-config

##### OpenSUSE

    $ zypper install python-pip python-devel python-tk libusb-1_0-devel libudev-devel

If you are using python3 or your system `pip` command points to `pip3.x`
(`/etc/alternatives/pip -> /usr/bin/pip3.6`) you will need to install these
dependencies instead:

    $ zypper install python3-pip python3-devel python3-tk libusb-1_0-devel libudev-devel

### GPG

If you intend to use GPG make sure you have GPG installed and up to date.  This software requires a GPG version >= 2.1.11.

You can verify your installed version by running:
```
$ gpg2 --version | head -n1
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.15
```

# 5. Installation Troubleshooting

If there is an import problem with the installed `protobuf` package,
see [this issue](https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent/issues/28) for fixing it.

If you can't find the command-line utilities (after running `pip install --user`),
please make sure that `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH` variable
(see a [relevant](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3813) issue).

If you can't find command-line utilities and are on macOS/OSX check `~/Library/Python/2.7/bin` and add to `PATH` if necessary (see a [relevant](https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent/issues/155) issue).
